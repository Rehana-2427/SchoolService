This is a microservice example  without uisng eureka server instead of eureka server here i am uisng RESTTEMPLATE to connect two springboot projects . 

Microservice : 
  Microservices is an architectural style where a large application is built as a collection of small, independent services, each responsible for a specific business functionality.

Key Features:
Each service is independently deployable

Each has its own database

Services communicate over HTTP (usually REST APIs)

Can be written in different programming languages

‚ùì Why Use Microservices?
Scalability	- You can scale only the part that needs it (e.g., scale Job Service only)
Maintainability -	Small, focused codebases are easier to manage
Flexibility -	Each team can work on different services independently
Faster - deployment	You can deploy one service without affecting others

Without Eureka server

Build multiple Spring Boot microservices

Connect them using RestTemplate or WebClient

Use manual URLs like http://localhost:8081/...

This is completely valid for:

Small projects

Local development

Simple microservices communication
